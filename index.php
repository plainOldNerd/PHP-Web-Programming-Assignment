		<p> Hi, my name's Joe Smith and after several years in Japan and a short trip or two home to Australia, I realised there are not many Japanese jigsaw puzzles available for retail in Australia, which I thought was a great shame. 
		</p>
      
		<p> I decided to start a business importing Japanese jigsaw puzzles and selling them. 
		</p>
      
		<p> I've also noticed that as a cultural difference, people in Australia seem not to frame jigsaw puzzles after completion, so stores don't sell frames.  This has frustrated me in the past, so I plan to, in future, start importing frames as well.
      <br />
          Keep your eyes on this site if you're interested in framing your jigsaw puzzles.
